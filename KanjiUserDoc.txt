an extremely basic and poorly written user requirements outline (and I apologize for that)

user requirements:
1. The user will be able to see various kanji symbols and input their translations in english
2. The system will have two seperate boxes for input, one input box for the "On" reading and the other for the "Kun" reading
3. Each box will be graded seperately so the user will know what is incorrect
4. If a word has multiple translations the user can enter them in a format seperate by \'s. i.e.: "chair/boat"
5. The kanji symbols will be images that are loaded from seperate files
6. The system will keep track of how many correct and incorrect inputs there were
7. The system will be programmed in the Java language to offer easy exportability to Android market if requested
