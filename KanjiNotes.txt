handling images:

Possibly a Card object that holds:
image location
on reading
kun reading
amount wrong
amount visited


We could possibly hold these objects in an array(or another data strucutre, such as a heap).
We wish to sort them based on amount wrong divided by amount visited, getting a statisical representation of which words you get wrong more.
Giving the words you get wrong more higher priority so you are forced to learn them 

- Stretch?: If you get a word wrong often but begin to improve its percentage, may cause the card to be dormant for some time before being played again
-brings in the idea that the heap/queue wont be completely just based off highest percentage but some strategy to how to choose cards
                        
                        
Also just a side note: We would need to output your stats to a file and then read the file every time the program is closed. So that takes time to reinitalize the data structure each time so something that has quick inserts is good. Heap offers both log(n) insertion and searching.
